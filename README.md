# eCS (Enlightened Critical Sections)

eCS (Enlightened Critical Sections) strive to address all preemption problems together by bridging the semantic gap between guest OSes and the hypervisor: the hypervisor now knows whether guest OSes are running in critical sections and a guest OS has hypervisorâ€™s scheduling context.

We annotate all critical sections by using the lightweight para-virtualized APIs, so we called enlightened critical sections (eCS), that provide scheduling hints to both the hypervisor and VMs. The hypervisor uses the hint to reschedule a vCPU to fundamentally overcome the double scheduling problem for these annotated critical sections and VMs use the hypervisor provided hints to further mitigate the blocked-waiter wake-up problem.

## Build and install the kernel

      - eCS was developed on Linux 4.13.
      - The Linux kernel source is available in ./linux/.
      - Select CONFIG_PARAVIRT_VCS option while compiling the Linex kernel.
      - Build and install the kernel.
